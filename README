This is a collection of scripts to make downloading and building mpv, ffmpeg
and libass easier. ffmpeg and libass get special treatment, because they are
essential, and distribution packages are often too old.

Update the ffmpeg, libass and mpv sources with the following command:

    ./update

This is also needed before doing the first build after the initial checkout.

Build mpv and ffmpeg/libass with:

    make mpv

Install mpv with:

    make install

mpv doesn't need to be installed. The binary in ./mpv/ can be used as-is. Note
that libass and ffmpeg will be statically linked with mpv when using the
provided scripts.
