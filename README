This is a collection of scripts to make downloading and building mpv, ffmpeg
and libass easier. ffmpeg and libass get special treatment, because they are
essential, and distribution packages are often too old or too broken.

Update the ffmpeg, libass and mpv sources with the following command:

    ./update

This is also needed before doing the first build after the initial checkout.

Build mpv and ffmpeg/libass with:

    make clean                        # sometimes needed to build successfully
    make

Install mpv with:

    sudo make install

Or if you don't want debugging symbols (smaller binaries):

    sudo make install-strip

mpv doesn't need to be installed. The binary ./mpv/mpv can be used as-is. Note
that libass and ffmpeg will be statically linked with mpv when using the
provided scripts, and no ffmpeg or libass libraries are/need to be installed.

Essential dependencies (incomplete list):
- gcc, yasm
- X development headers (xlib, X extensions, vdpau, GL, Xv, ...)
- Audio output development headers (libasound, pulseaudio)
- fribidi, freetype, fontconfig development headers (for libass)
- libjpeg
- libquvi if you want to play Youtube videos directly
- libx264 if you want to use encoding (you have to add --enable-libx264 to
  scripts/ffmpeg-config, because ffmpeg doesn't autodetect this library)

Note: most dependencies are optional and autodetected. If they're missing,
these features will be disabled silently. This includes some dependencies
which could be considered essential.
